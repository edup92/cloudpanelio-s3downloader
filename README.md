## download_backups.sh

This script automates the retrieval of backup archives (`backup.tar`) from an AWS S3 bucket generated by cloudpanel.io hosting panel

---

### Prerequisites

* **AWS CLI** installed and configured with valid credentials and appropriate permissions to access the target S3 bucket.
* **Bash shell** (version 4+ recommended).

### Script Workflow

- Finds the most recent YYYY-MM-DD/ folder under backups/ in your S3 bucket.
- Acceses the only subdirectory and then the home/ folder inside it.
- Downloads to local machine each backup.tar from client subfolders up to the YYYY-MM-DD folder, renaming them to <client_name>.tar.

 git clone https://github.com/edup92/cloudpanelio-s3downloader.git ; chmod +x cloudpanelio-s3downloader/download_backups.sh ; ./cloudpanelio-s3downloader/download_backups.sh <bucket-name>
